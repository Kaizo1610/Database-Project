# Ibadah Camp Management System (IBMS)

## Introduction
The **Ibadah Camp Management System (IBMS)** is designed to efficiently manage the data of students participating in Ibadah Camps at IIUM. These camps aim to provide students with opportunities to enhance their knowledge of Fardhu Ain, such as performing Salah, reciting the Quran, and observing fasting. 

The primary goal of IBMS is to:
- Streamline the management of participant data.
- Prevent data loss.
- Provide a platform for Islamic knowledge enrichment.

## Features
- **Student Management**: Keep track of student details, including their kulliyyah, gender, and contact information.
- **Module Overview**: Manage information about various camp modules, their budgets, locations, and committee assignments.
- **Activity Tracking**: Record activities, their schedules, and purposes.
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track the status of activities and manage unused budgets.
- **Feedback System**: Collect and analyze feedback from participants to improve future camps.

## Database Structure
IBMS is supported by a relational database that includes the following entities:
1. **Students**: Stores student details.
2. **Modules**: Manages information about different camp modules.
3. **Activities**: Tracks scheduled activities.
4. **Progress**: Records the status and financial progress of activities.
5. **Feedback**: Stores participant feedback and ratings.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ERD captures the relationships between the entities to ensure effective data management.

## How It Works
- Participants register for the camp.
- Administrators use IBMS to manage module details, activities, and track progress.
- Feedback is collected post-camp for evaluation and improvement.

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: Oracle SQL for database management.
- **Web Application**: Oracle APEX for the user interface and functionality.
- **Programming**: SQL for stored procedures and functions.

## Setup
1. **Database Setup**: Use the provided SQL scripts to create tables and populate sample data.
2. **Web Application**: Use Oracle APEX to host and manage the application.
